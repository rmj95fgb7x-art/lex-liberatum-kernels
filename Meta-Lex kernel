# Meta-Lex Kernel

**Patent-pending, royalty-bearing decision kernel.**  
25 bp of every compliance decision → irrevocable trust.  
Same CREATE2 on every L2.

**Legal owner:** *Lex Libertatum Trust, A.T.W.W., Trustee*  
Irrevocable, discretionary, spendthrift, complex.

**Patent:** USPTO provisional filed (micro-entity, $0 fee)  
**Royalty splitter:** `0x9f3D7662f0D76fcF86fF3Ef42bF6c0E25742A38B` (CREATE2-deployed)

## Vision

Meta-Lex is the self-healing rule clock of the Lex Libertatum ecosystem — the foundational kernel that verifies whether any action, transaction, or state transition complies with a specified legal or regulatory rule at an exact nanosecond in time.

It functions as a deterministic, immutable oracle for legal truth: given a rule set (encoded as pure code), a timestamped input, and cryptographic proof of context, Meta-Lex issues a court-ready certificate attesting compliance (or non-compliance).

Meta-Lex powers every higher-level kernel (LexClaim, LexYacht, LexDocket, etc.) by providing the base-layer guarantee: "This event satisfied the encoded law at this precise moment."

It turns subjective legal interpretation into objective, reproducible computation — enforceable truth, directly in code.

## Uniqueness

- No direct equivalent exists: combines legal-grade rule encoding with nanosecond-precision verification and immutable certification.
- Pure deterministic code (no AI, no oracles, no trusted parties).
- Self-healing: rule updates are versioned immutably; old rules remain verifiable forever.
- Composable: any kernel or external system can query Meta-Lex for a compliance certificate.
- Patent-pending design ensures micro-royalty capture on every decision across all dependent kernels.

## Core Flow

1. **Rule Registration** — Trusted rule authority (court, regulator, or protocol governance) deploys a rule module.
2. **Verification Request** — Adapter submits input data + Merkle proof + timestamp.
3. **Decision Execution** — Meta-Lex runs the exact rule version applicable at the anchor timestamp.
4. **Certificate Issuance** — If compliant → mint invoice via DecisionToken/RoyaltySplitter (25 bp to trust).
5. **Immutable Record** — Certificate hash stored forever; verifiable by any court or auditor.
