# LexYacht

**LexLibertatum Kernel** – Immutable Marine & Yacht Safety Certificate Logger

### Purpose

`LexYacht` is premium, royalty-bearing infrastructure for logging mandatory yacht safety certificates on-chain (IMO SOLAS, USCG CFR Title 46, Lloyd’s Register, flag-state surveys).

It targets the highest-value compliance vein in maritime:
- Every yacht > 300 GT must carry valid safety certificates before departure.
- Non-compliance = immediate port exclusion + fines up to $500k+ per incident.
- Data is confidential & often export-controlled → only US-based, ITAR-compliant pipelines are legally viable.

This kernel provides:
- Immutable, timestamped proof of certificate filing.
- Cryptographic ownership/title registry (ERC-721).
- Merkle-proof attachment of sensitive documents (surveys, class certificates, bills of sale).
- Deterministic compliance checks (via no-std Rust kernel).
- 25 bp royalty on every compliance decision → irrevocable trust.

Neutral infrastructure only: no oracles, no admins, no governance, no backdoors.

### Royalty Model

- Tier: Premium Marine (8–10% equivalent, same as pharma/space).
- Volume: ~8,000 superyacht/mega-yacht certificates processed daily globally (renewals, surveys, flag changes).
- Gas: ~125k per filing.
- Royalty: 25 basis points → ~$27M annual from yachts alone.
- Upside: Extend to cruise ships, commercial fleets → $150M+ yr runway by 2028.

### Components

- `chain/src/LexYachtAdapter.sol` – ERC-721 adapter for immutable certificate tokens + data hashes.
- `templates/lexyacht/src/lib.rs` – no-std Rust kernel for deterministic SOLAS/USCG rule enforcement.
- `templates/DeployLexYacht.sol` – Foundry deployment script.

### Features

- Unique yacht tokens (IMO number + tokenId).
- Off-chain document proofs via Merkle roots + IPFS/Arweave URI.
- Expiry-aware validation hooks (Rust kernel).
- Composable with `LexClaim` (marine insurance payouts), `LexCola` (liens), `LexTrack` (provenance).
- Immutable after deployment – upgradability-free.

### Deployment

```bash
forge script templates/DeployLexYacht.sol:DeployLexYacht \
    --rpc-url $RPC_URL \
    --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
    --broadcast \
